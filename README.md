# POS-tagging with HMMs and the Viterbi algorithm

This project was dedicated to tackling the task of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging through the application of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi Algorithm. The core objective was to design and implement a sophisticated system capable of accurately identifying and labeling the grammatical parts of speech in given text segments.

To achieve this, I employed Hidden Markov Models, which are statistical models that represent the probabilities of various outcomes in a sequence. In the context of POS tagging, these outcomes correspond to different grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. The system was designed to analyze sequences of words in text and predict the most likely part of speech for each word, based on the probabilities modeled by the HMMs.

The Viterbi Algorithm played a critical role in this system. It is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the most probable sequence of hidden states â€“ in this case, the sequence of parts of speech that best explains the observed sequence of words. This algorithm is particularly effective in dealing with the computational challenges posed by the large number of potential combinations in language processing. Moreover, I integrated a rule-based tagger into the algorithm to better adapt it for handling new words.

Additionally, the project briefly explored the field of Conditional Random Fields, examining their potential application in this context.

The development process involved integrating these probabilistic models with optimization techniques. These techniques were employed to refine the model's parameters and enhance its accuracy in POS tagging. This step was crucial as it directly impacted the system's performance in real-world applications.
