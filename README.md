# POS-tagging with HMMs and the Viterbi algorithm

This project focused on implementing Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi Algorithm for Part-of-Speech tagging in Natural Language Processing. It involved developing a system to accurately identify grammatical parts of speech in text, using probabilistic models and optimisation techniques, crucial for applications in computational linguistic.
